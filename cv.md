Hi.  

I want to share my story, my thoughts and conclusions that I have received over the past couple of years.
I'm just an ordinary worker in the chemical industry. For 14 years, I changed 4 professions, because every time I look for something more profitable for myself. 
And now, with a decent salary for my small town, I could stop. Now, at 35, I could finally turn my life into a black-and-white movie, where black is work and white is 
weekends, vacations and salaries. Many of my entourage did so.
