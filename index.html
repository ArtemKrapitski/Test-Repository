        <h2>Briefly about me</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Hi. <br> 
            I want to share my story, my thoughts and conclusions that I have received over the past couple of years.
            I'm just an ordinary worker in the chemical industry. For 14 years, I changed 4 professions, because every time I look for something more profitable for myself. And now, with a decent salary for my small town, I could stop. Now, at 35, I could finally turn my life into a black-and-white movie, where black is work and white is weekends, vacations and salaries. Many of my entourage did so.
            </p>

    <div>
        <p>But one happy day I thought that if every time I managed to change my profession, if every time I achieved my goal (and it was very difficult), then I can do more, I have some inner strength, and I felt it.
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>I started to get interested in what makes money, big money. Something I could do for my own pleasure and at any time. I saw a lot of ads on the Internet with big headlines like " work from anywhere "or" travel and don't worry" and didn't believe them at all. But over time, I realized that if you don't try, you won't learn anything.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>For two years, I was interested in many things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>investments</li>
            <li>automatic trading</li>
            <li>ads</li>
            <li>network business</li>
            <li>freelance</li>
            <li>YouTube</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So many possibilities! <b>Where have I been before?</b></p>
        <img src="./images/myfoto5.jpg" alt="" width="200">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I'm still doing some things, but I decided to try a new direction. And not just to try, but to learn a new profession. <b>And here I am...</b><br> <br>
            I don't have any programming experience (except for simple formulas in Google spreadsheets), but I really want to learn how to continue working in this area. A good friend told me about RSS courses, for which I am eternally grateful)
            Thank You for what you do for people! For the future of people!
            </p>
