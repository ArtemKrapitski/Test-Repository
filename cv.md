Hi.  

I want to share my story, my thoughts and conclusions that I have received over the past couple of years.
I'm just an ordinary worker in the chemical industry. For 14 years, I changed 4 professions, because every time I look for something more profitable for myself. 
And now, with a decent salary for my small town, I could stop. Now, at 35, I could finally turn my life into a black-and-white movie, where black is work and white is 
weekends, vacations and salaries. Many of my entourage did so.

But one happy day I thought that if every time I managed to change my profession, if every time I achieved my goal (and it was very difficult), then I can do more, I have some inner strength, and I felt it.
I started to get interested in what makes money, big money. Something I could do for my own pleasure and at any time. I saw a lot of ads on the Internet with big headlines like " work from anywhere "or" travel and don't worry" and didn't believe them at all. But over time, I realized that if you don't try, you won't learn anything.

For two years, I was interested in many things:
investments
automatic trading
ads
network business
freelance
YouTube

So many possibilities! Where have I been before?
